<h3>Data Scaling Laws in Imitation Learning for Robotic Manipulation</h3>
**Fanqi Lin\***, **Yingdong Hu\***, **Pingyue Sheng**, Chuan Wen, Jiacheng You, Yang Gao  

Workshop on X-Embodiment Robot Learning, CoRL 2024  
üèÜ **Best Paper Award**  

[Code](https://github.com/Fanqi-Lin/Data-Scaling-Laws)\ [Project Page](https://data-scaling-laws.github.io/) \ [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18647)

We demonstrate that the policy's generalization ability to new objects, new environments, or both scales approximately as a power law with the number of training objects, training environments, or training environment-object pairs, respectively.

<h3>DreamFactory: Grounding Language Models to World Models [Code](https://github.com/knightnemo/nlp-proj)[Paper](https://github.com/knightnemo/nlp-proj)</h3>
- Investigated the feasibility of utilizing language models as text-based world models
- Through empirical study, discovered performance limitations caused by overlengthy Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs)
- Proposed DreamFactory, a novel architecture to address the CoT length issue and improve model performance
