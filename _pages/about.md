# Welcome to My Academic Page

## About Me
I am Pingyue Sheng (盛平岳 in chinese), an undergraduate student at the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at Tsinghua University. My research interests center around robotics, imitation learning, and algorithms.


## Education
- **Tsinghua University** (清华大学)
  - Bachelor's Degree, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (Yao class)
  - Focus on Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence




## Publications

### Data Scaling Laws in Imitation Learning for Robotic Manipulation
<img src='/images/scaling-law.png'>

**Fanqi Lin\***, **Yingdong Hu\***, **Pingyue Sheng**, Chuan Wen, Jiacheng You, Yang Gao  

Workshop on X-Embodiment Robot Learning, CoRL 2024  
🏆 **Best Paper Award**  

[Code](https://github.com/Fanqi-Lin/Data-Scaling-Laws) \ [Project Page](https://data-scaling-laws.github.io/) \ [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18647)

We demonstrate that the policy's generalization ability to new objects, new environments, or both scales approximately as a power law with the number of training objects, training environments, or training environment-object pairs, respectively.



## Projects

### Course Sharing Platform

[Code](https://github.com/knightnemo/WEB_PROJ)
- Designed and implemented a PostgreSQL-based course sharing platform using Scala for backend and React for frontend
- Utilized Stable Diffusion 2 and Llama 2 API to enhance users experiences

### DreamFactory: Grounding Language Models to World Models 
[Code](https://github.com/knightnemo/nlp-proj) \ [Paper](https://github.com/knightnemo/nlp-proj)
- Investigated the feasibility of utilizing language models as text-based world models
- Through empirical study, discovered performance limitations caused by overlengthy Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs)
- Proposed DreamFactory, a novel architecture to address the CoT length issue and improve model performance

## Miscs
- I'm an avid fitness enthusiast:muscle:
- I'm a big fan of anime, especially 終末なにしてますか？忙しいですか？救ってもらっていいですか？
